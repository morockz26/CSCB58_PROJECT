---------------
Project Title: Snake

Project Description: A simple game of snake played using the DE2 board.

serve as a useful resource for future development):


Proposal
--------

What do you plan to have completed by the end of the first lab session?:

Movement of the snake using keys and food spawning on the screen. Other miscellaneous things such as pausing, a start menu, etc.

What do you plan to have completed by the end of the second lab session?:

Collision detection of the head of the snake with the food, itself and the walls. When the snake eats food it gets longer, and when it hits itself or the edge of the screen it dies. A game over screen for when the player dies.

What do you plan to have completed by the end of the third lab session?:

Points for eating food and a high score table. Extra time for bugs and extra things to be added.

What is your backup plan if things don’t work out as planned?

What hardware will you need beyond the DE2 board ?
(be sure to e-mail Brian if it’s anything beyond the basics to make sure there’s enough to go around)

No hardware beyond the DE2 board will be needed for this project.

Motivations
-----------
How does this project relate to the material covered in CSCB58?:

The project will relate to the material covered in CSCB58 by using verilog and the vga to display our game. We will also be using FSMs and ALUs to control the data of what is being displayed on the screen.

Why is this project interesting/cool (for CSCB58 students, and for non CSCB58 students?):

This project will be cool because the game we are going to make will probably be addicting and fun and you can compete with your fellow classmates to get the high score.

Why did you personally choose this project?:

The members of our group are interested in video games and this is the most complex idea we could think of without extra resources.

Updates

Week 1:

We made the code to make the snake move. We ended up getting the snake to move with the keys in the direction we wanted it to go, but there was a problem deleting the trailing squares whenever the snake would move. There was also a problem with the snake going up, so we had to change our FSM to fix that (took a look to debug).
